# Hands-on learning how LLMs work with Claude

I learn best through hands-on building and experimentation. In this project, I worked with Claude Code as a tutor. The Rust code is generally written by human hands, and the role of Claude was to provide LLM training and inference pipeline architecture, plan some tasks, answer questions (Socratically), and write unit tests after I was done to confirm that the code worked as intended. Occasionally, I asked Claude to stub out function signatures and docs for me when we got into really new domains.

This is sort of an inversion of the way we presently _build_ things with AI; a detailed (perhaps AI-assisted) plan would be the _input_ to inference of generated code. But the goal here was not to build, it was to _learn_. So, employing Claude as a didactic expert who pushes me to build was a great way to learn.

See [PLAN.md](./PLAN.md) for details about what I built.
